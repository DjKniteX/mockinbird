                    Originally planned as an RPG Maker MV sequel to one of my (Nikki's) project I did for class, Cartuga. The original source files for the game were lost because I forgot to 
                    make a backup before I did a reformat so the project died in 2019. The game was originally supposed to be another single player quick RPG with the last entry being the online one. But we decided
                    to make this one online.

                    You will travel through different biomes, from the lush forests of the greenbelt to the arid deserts of the wastelands. You will meet new people and learn about their cultures. And you will discover the secrets of the ancient world, which will help you in your quest to stop the evil from rising.
