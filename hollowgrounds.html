                    Originally planned as an RPG Maker MV sequel to one of my (Nikki's) project I did for class,
                    Cartuga, as Gralina but decided to bridge the trilogy together as an online game. The original source files for the game were lost because I forgot to
                    make a backup before I did a reformat so the project died in 2019. The game was originally supposed
                    to be another single player quick RPG with the last entry being the online one. But we decided
                    to make this one online. Inspired by classics such as Deloria Online, Ragnarok Online, and Runescape
                    (Among many more).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Created in-house by gameJeeNi, Episode 1: Gralina will be the retelling of the RPG Maker MV game that never was come to light. Episode 2 will mark the game's last update before we venture off into a new project 
                    possibly with the same Engine. While Episode 2 is on the pipeline, don't expect the game's life span to fall short.
